              What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without
              being a sports car.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater,
              two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble
              handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in
              1919. According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first
              known use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to become
              popular during the 1920s.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability
              and light weight are requisite. Sports cars are usually
              aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of
              gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are
              typically designed for precise control at high speeds.
              Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s
              also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the
              distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not
              absolute.

              Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and
              early sporting regulations often demanded four seats (even
              three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats
              became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may
              also have small back seats that are often really only suitable for
              luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as
              a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to
              increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the
              seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the
              center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on
              each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was
              originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as
              impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit
              the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their F1.
